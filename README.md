# Assembler_ch6

This Python program is a full fucntiong assembler. Built in Python for course CS 210. The process API is compliments of an authored text called "From Nand to Tetris", the assembler ONLY works if you are using the hack aseembly language, but of course can be easily adapted if properly edited.
